## PakUI
A collection of paks/tools for MinUI ONLY - PakUI is a full set and most paks talk to one another. You will need the full release on a fresh card and new install. Fresh format card ONLY. Sorry PakUI is not compatible with other MinUI variants or forks.

## Compatibility
- **MinUI ONLY**  
- **TrimUI Brick**  
- **TrimUI Smart Pro** (note: RetroArch coming soon for TSP) 
- More devices coming soon!

## Installation

To get started with PakUI, follow these easy steps:

1. **Prepare Your SD Card:**  
   Format a fresh SD card to fat32. Must use fresh format card and fat32 only.

2. **Extract & Install:**  
   Unzip the entire release package—**do not unzip individual folders inside**. Make sure that all folders and hidden files are preserved. The release includes both MinUI and TrimUI_EX (NOTE: this changes your device and upgrades some internal files needed. A fresh format card is required and ALL files in the release for this reason) along with everything you need for a complete installation. Copy all the files and folders directly onto your formatted SD card. Paks are not compatible with other MinUI variations/forks and the full package needs to stay together for everything to work.

- **Your SD card should look like this**

4. **Add Your Own Files:**  
   Once the file transfer to your SD card is complete, simply add your games and BIOS files to the appropriate folders.

5. **Boot Up:**  
   Insert the SD card into your TrimUI Brick or TrimUI Smart Pro, then power on your device and let the magic happen!

It's that simple—enjoy and happy gaming!
